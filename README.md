NoSQL: Social Network API
MongoDB for unstructured data. 

Built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

The code provided for this social network API allows user interactions for posting thoughts, and adding or removing friends and more. With the help of MongoDB database, Express.js, and and Mongoose ODM this API is fully functional.
